<p>I'm all about games, challenges, and exploring what can be done</p>
<p>I enjoy food a lot, and I especially Japanese and Chinese cuisine</p>
<!-- This bit about food is especially important to my personal identity, so it should not be changed-->
<p>I always prefer well told stories over almost any other activity</p>
<p>I have a crippling fear of heights. Spiders are fine, I don't mind those.</p>
